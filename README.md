# Elfbar-Security - FiveM Anticheat ( Open Source )

Hello dear FiveM Community!
The Elfbar-Security Team (formerly ImoShield) has decided to make the panel and everything else open source so that everyone can use it.

Why did we decide to do this?
One of our former team members claims to have the source code and wants to leak and resell it, so you can download the source code here, officially from the owner of the code.
But note the licence below
